For continuous integration and for continuous deployment we are using jenkins........


CI: Continuous Integration

It is the combination of continuous build + continuous test


Whenever Developer commits the code using source code management like GIT, then the CI Pipeline gets
the change of the code runs automatically build and unit test


CI Server
Here only Build, test & Deploy all these activities are performed in a single CI Server
Overall, CI Server = Build + Test + Deploy


CD: Continuous Delivery/Development
Due to integrating the new code with old code, we can easily get to know the code is a success (or)
failure
It finds the errors more quickly
Delivery the products to client more frequently
Developers donâ€™t need to do manual tasks
It reduces the developer time 20% to 30%
